                <h1>Neural Networks</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>A neural network is</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>a general function approximator</li>
                        <p>
                                Given any set of points there are controls such
                                that it outputs a curve approximating them
                                pretty well.
                        </p>
                        <li>that is efficiently trainable.</li>
                        <p>
                                There is an efficient algorithm to find those
                                controls.
                        </p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                        The "network" in "neural network" is a network, or
                        graph, of symbols connected into a complex expression.
                        Some of the nodes in the graph have inputs. In each case
                        some of these are wired to the outputs of upstream
                        nodes; the rest are "control parameters", adjusting
                        which changes the node's output on its inputs.
                </p>
                <p>Consider the following graph:</p>
                <img
                        src="workspace/example_nn.png"
                        alt="A simple neural network"
                />
                <p>
                        This symbol graph takes two numbers, forms a composite,
                        passes it into two different normal functions with
                        controls, then sums the two outputs. All the control is
                        on the two normal functions, whose centers and spreads
                        are variable.
                </p>
