<h1>Networking</h1>

<p>The basic thing is the MAC address. Network connections facilitated by a piece of hardware called a network interface. Each network interface has a single unique identifier called a MAC address. </p>
<p>A single network interface can belong to multiple networks. On a given network the interface has an IP address, subnet mask and possibly a gateway. The IP address is the MAC's presence on a network. The subnet mask associated defines the shape of the neighborhood of IP addresses centered on the IP address considered "local". The gateway is one such neighbor to which requests for nonlocal IPs are sent.
