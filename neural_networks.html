                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                        It often happens that one <i>can</i> do something, but
                        it is not possible to state at the level of exact
                        procedure how it is done. Still though: usually one can
                        explain pretty well from some high level downward to a
                        certain point what was done. The peculiar problem is a
                        case of a general one. Knowing the general algorithm and
                        having an efficient way to reify it into a solution of
                        the specific problem is the goal. Stated precisely we
                        would like a thing with controls A taking inputs X which
                        is:

                        <li>a general function approximator</li>
                        <p>
                                Given a set any set of points over [0, 1]^n
                                there are A such that it becomes a curve
                                approximating them pretty well.

                        <p>
                                There is an efficient algorithm to find A given
                                the set of points.

                        "Neural network" is a misleadingly specific name for a
                        way to fit curves that ought to be called something like
                        "large symbol graph methods" or "large
                        alternately-clamped energy-minimzation loops".

                <p>
                        The "network" in "neural network" is a network, or
                        graph, of symbols connected into a complex expression.
                        Some of the nodes in the graph have inputs. In each case
                        some of these are wired to the outputs of upstream
                        nodes; the rest are "control parameters", adjusting
                        which changes the node's output on its inputs.
