    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      It often happens that one <i>can</i> do something, but it is not possible
      to state at the level of exact procedure how it is done. Even if one
      could, there is a sense that it isn't really the point. The procedure is a
      concrete instance of a more general class of procedures, which are in turn
      a case of a still more general class, and so on.
